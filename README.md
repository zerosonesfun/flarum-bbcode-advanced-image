# Flarum BBCode - Advanced Image

Adds an image BBCode to Flarum which allows extra attributes compared to the default image BBCode.

The default image BBCode is `[img]` and so in order to not cause conflicts, this BBCode uses the full word, `[image]`.

The code with all options (although, only the URL is required):

`[image=example.com/image.png width=100% class=cool alt=This in image title=The title]`

Install using composer:
`composer require zerosonesfun/flarum-bbcode-advanced-image:"*"`
